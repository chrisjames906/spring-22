True360, Inc. was started in a dorm room at Iowa State University in November of 2016 by Christopher James. The company originally started out as a ROV manufacturer when Christopher James to bring the joy of SCUBA to a broader – and drier – audience by placing a 360° camera on an ROV and stream the footage to a VR headset. This way people could drive the ROV around and feel like they were SCUBA diving. Christopher James brought the ROV to SEA Life, the largest franchiser of aquariums with over 50 locations worldwide, who really like the immersive concept, but not the ROV itself. So he removed the ROV, kept the camera, and True360 was born.
